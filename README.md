Our program helps the user choose a meal based on the specific situation they are in. For example somebody might be in a hurry and want to make some kind of quick meal while somebody else might be trying to save money and make a cheap meal. Our program includes cheap meals, healthy meals, quick meals, fast food, and restaurants. The program asks the user what type of meal they want. After they choose, it'll provide them with a list specifically made for that category. The user will choose an entree, two sides, and a drink. Our program also calculates the total cost of the meal the user chooses. We also included a cookbook in the program. The user can select to view the cookbook and will be asked to choose one of the categories. After picking a category they will receive a specific list of meals and be prompted to the cookbook for the recipe.

The user will need to download both csv files and must download the cookbook from the website link.
